The main goal is to complete this course, get basic skills in JavaScript and continue self-development in this direction. I start my training almost from scratch, but I have a very strong desire and good motivation to continue my training.As they say, it is better to train a new person than to retrain a person who already knows this area.
I don't have any skills in this area yet, but I am ready to study hard.
I have higher education, economic.
I studied English at the University, the level of knowledge of the language is average, I continue to improve it.
